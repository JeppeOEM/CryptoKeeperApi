// In TypeScript, DTO stands for "Data Transfer Object." A DTO is a design pattern used to transfer data between software application
// subsystems or layers, typically between the client and server in a distributed system. 
//The primary purpose of a DTO is to encapsulate and transport data in a format that is easy to work with, 
//efficient to transfer, and matches the communication requirements between different parts of the system.
